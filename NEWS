MAJOR CHANGES/IMPROVEMENTS

  - The collapse() function was changed to collapse_obs() to avoid namespace clashing with dplyr's collapse().

  - Better garbage collection

NEW FEATURES

  - First version of XML2R. See the package [tutorial](http://cpsievert.github.io/XML2R/)

  - This package was born out of an effort to abstract the functionality of [pitchRx::urlsToDataFrame](https://github.com/cpsievert/pitchRx/blob/master/R/urlsToDataFrame.R) so that other projects can be built on top of this framework.
