\title{Parse XML files into a list of "observations"}
\usage{
  XML2Obs(urls, xpath, append.value = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{urls}{character vector or list of urls that point
  to an XML file (or anything readable by
  \link{xmlParse}).}

  \item{xpath}{XML XPath expression that is passed to
  \link{getNodeSet}. If missing, the entire root and all
  descendents are captured and returned (ie, tables =
  "/").}

  \item{append.value}{logical. Should the XML value be
  appended for relevant observations?}
}
\value{
  A list of "observations" and the "url_map" element.
}
\description{
  This function takes a collection of urls that point to
  XML files and coerces the relevant info into a list of
  observations. An "observation" is defined as a matrix
  with one row. An observation can also be thought of as a
  single instance of XML attributes (and value) for a
  particular level in the XML hierarchy. The names of the
  list reflect the XML node ancestory for which each
  observation was extracted from.
}
\details{
  It's worth noting that a "url_key" column is appended to
  each observation to help track the origin of each
  observation. The value of the "url_key" column is not the
  actual file name, but a simplified identifier to avoid
  unnecessarily repeating long file names for each
  observation. For this reason, an addition element (named
  "url_map") is added to the list of observations in case
  the actual file named want to be used.
